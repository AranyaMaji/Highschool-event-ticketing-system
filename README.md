# Built during Highschool for a one-off event


This was an automated email sent to customers after purchase of ticket through payments interface coded into my site.

This was the site that staff at gate would use to scan the tickets. The scanner tab has the scanner. The Checklist tab is a searchable backup list of all those who purchased tickets to the event in case of them forgetting their tickets. 
Data currently unavailable, but was used by over 800 attendees.
